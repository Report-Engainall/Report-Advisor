# Master Execution Index — Dual-Owner UI/Runtime Wave — 2026-09-18

> Append-only operational synchronization. This document does not promote runtime/certification evidence across exact SHA boundaries.

## Current Code / Repository Boundary

- Last product code on `main`: `c11c084d161cceb4595f8552b6c49c3f610f0ec2`.
- Last repository HEAD: `c42214361bde9be484eab622adf7c6065a37af3e` (documentation-only synchronization after the Netlify production build).
- Netlify Production deploy: `6aacf9923a7df1ba382c67d4`, state `ready`, deployed from `c11c084...`.
- Netlify production external fetch remains `401` because the project requires team SSO; this is not treated as an application build failure.

## Owner Tracks

### UI/Product Experience — ChatGPT

Open UI wave: **PR #591**
- Branch: `feat/aghbari-ui-full-wave-20260918-r2`
- Current exact head: `60824e7b6dae2e10acffc56ee5b5f54dc9ba54ab`
- Scope: shared Aghbari PageHeader, evidence-table hierarchy, RTL normalization, Demand Velocity, Alternative Groups, Company Settings presentation, accessible login action name, UI contract parser hardening, dashboard truth test formatting, and heavy PDF/OCR vendor chunk splitting.
- No new RPC, runner, database mutation, fake data, fake evidence, or certification bypass.
- Netlify Deploy Preview: `deploy-preview-591--aghbari-report-advisor.netlify.app`, state `ready`, build/deploy successful.
- Public preview content fetch succeeded and returned the Aghbari Arabic login shell plus expected PWA metadata.
- Deep-route fetches (`/work-center`, `/import`, `/reports`, `/analytics`, `/intelligence`, `/settings`) correctly resolved to the authenticated login surface; this proves SPA fallback and auth gating, not authenticated business runtime.
- Vercel remains externally rate-limited; Netlify is the active preview surface.
- PR #591 is **not merged** and is **not a certification candidate**.

### Engineering/Runtime/Release — Programmer

Open engineering wave: **PR #587**
- Branch: `commercial/comprehensive-product-development-20260918-v5`
- Exact head: `866e39b50b00cb52b98c9cb97974c91b135bbf06`
- Known exact-head findings:
  - `ReportsPage.tsx`: five undefined `errorMessage` references causing TypeScript/build readiness failure.
  - UI route completeness parser was whitespace-sensitive against Sidebar `path: '...'` syntax.
  - Dashboard truth adversarial assertion was formatting-sensitive for `categoryStatus === 'UNKNOWN'`.
  - Browser E2E login action name mismatch was blocking authenticated browser flows.
  - Phase-F live resilience remains externally blocked by missing `RESILIENCE_*` runtime configuration.
- These findings were posted directly to PR #587. No historical Evidence is promoted.
- PR #587 remains the programmer-owned runtime/certification stream and is **not merged**.

## Current Strict Blockers

1. Real authenticated browser E2E / Actor A-B / business persistence proof remains unproven.
2. Positive PDF/OCR commit path remains unproven on the current exact candidate until fresh runtime evidence closes `POSITIVE_POLICY_COMMIT_UNAVAILABLE`.
3. Worker recovery/expiry/DLQ runtime evidence remains required.
4. Storage/realtime/AI retrieval/backup-RPO-RTO/rollback/SLO/security release evidence remains independently required.
5. Phase-F resilience live configuration remains externally blocked.
6. PC01 Remote Desktop runtime is currently reported offline; no device-local PASS is inferred.
7. Supabase security advisor currently flags 43 authenticated-callable SECURITY DEFINER functions for caller/boundary review and one RLS-enabled table (`import_field_lineage`) without policies. No blanket revoke or destructive hardening has been performed.

## Governance

- Closed work is not reopened without SHA/environment/contract change.
- UI PRs are not treated as production certification.
- Certification remains fail-closed.
- Historical evidence is never transferred to a new exact HEAD.
- Staging-first remains mandatory for mutable DB work.
