# PROJECT KNOWLEDGE MANIFEST — الأغبري / Report-Advisor
Status: CANONICAL LINEAGE / CONSOLIDATION LEDGER
Authority: inventory and deletion gate only

## 1. Purpose
This manifest prevents information loss while the repository is consolidated. It never becomes a second source of product or engineering truth.

Deletion sequence:
INVENTORIED -> CLASSIFIED -> CONTENT ABSORBED -> REFERENCES CHECKED -> TESTS PASS -> MANIFEST RECORDED -> ARCHIVE/REMOVE

No source is marked REMOVE during an inventory-only pass.

## 4. Historical evidence is not duplicate product truth
Dated forensic evidence, exact-run artifacts, migration records, production snapshots and adversarial ledgers may remain historical because timestamp and immutable context are evidence. They are referenced from canonical masters, not used as product definitions.

## 5. Executable source is not copied into prose
Executable truth remains in:
src/, services/, api/, netlify/, supabase/, scripts/, .github/workflows/, tests/

The Manifest records what execution surfaces prove or protect; it does not duplicate their entire source.

## 6. Mandatory migration record
For every source selected for consolidation record:
- source path
- source SHA
- target owner
- unique rules extracted
- references/dependencies inspected
- tests/checks run
- unresolved conflicts
- final disposition
- absorption date/SHA

## 7. Deletion gate
A source may be physically deleted only when all are true:
- no unabsorbed unique content
- references/callers inspected
- no workflow/test dependency
- canonical owner contains the durable rule
- historical evidence retained when needed
- relevant checks pass
- deletion itself is a reviewed repository change

Otherwise status remains RETAIN.

## 8. First consolidation wave
1. PROGRAMMER_AUTONOMOUS_OPERATING_PROTOCOL -> SYSTEM_HEART
2. PROJECT_EXECUTION_INDEX -> MASTER_EXECUTION_INDEX pointer cleanup
3. REPORT_ADVISOR_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE -> MASTER_ENGINEERING_ARCHITECTURE
4. MASTER_PRODUCT_UI_ARCHITECTURE + UI/design-system specs -> MASTER_UI_UX_REFERENCE
5. runtime matrices/runbooks -> MASTER_RUNTIME_CERTIFICATION
6. tenant/security/data contracts -> MASTER_DATA_TRUTH_SECURITY
7. GTM/productization -> MASTER_COMMERCIAL_REFERENCE

Do not delete these sources in wave 1. Absorb, verify, then archive/remove in later gated waves.

## 9. Current consolidation status
CONTROL_PLANE_ESTABLISHED / CONTENT_MIGRATION_PENDING

The repository now has a canonical destination for each major knowledge class. The next work is content absorption and proof, not creation of additional competing master files.

## 10. Verified first-wave absorption records

- Status: ABSORBED / SOURCE RETAINED

## 11. Current deletion decision
No source above is authorized for deletion yet.

Reason: absorption into canonical files is demonstrated for the reviewed source content, but repository-wide reference/caller checks and affected contract verification must still be completed before archive/remove. Historical evidence must remain retained where it has evidentiary value.

## 12. Consolidation wave control
Do not start a deletion wave until:
1. all source families selected for that wave are mapped;
2. unique content extraction is complete;
3. repository references/callers are checked;
4. affected contracts/tests pass;
5. canonical owner is re-read at the resulting SHA;
6. Manifest status is updated from ABSORBED to ARCHIVE-READY;
7. only then may a separate deletion commit be created.


## 13. UI / experience consolidation wave — 2026-09-22 — ABSORBED / SOURCE RETAINED

Four reviewed sources were merged into `docs/MASTER_UI_UX_REFERENCE.md` and remain retained until the deletion gate is separately proven:

1. `docs/COMMERCIAL_NAVIGATION_IA_2026-09-18.md` — source SHA `8d0fc65056a264e13a5ed1d023750b0e48bdd28c` — absorbed business-goal navigation language, progressive disclosure, short primary navigation, and high-value shortcuts.
2. `docs/COMMERCIAL_UI_PRODUCT_SURFACE_MASTER_SPEC_2026-09-18.md` — source SHA `f2e2a63322e234fae75d05984bee8fa22e8bf9d3` — absorbed outcome-first UI, role-aware surfaces, actionability, decision/evidence flow, report-as-decision-document semantics, and completion criteria.
3. `docs/PRODUCT_EXPERIENCE_PRINCIPLES.md` — source SHA `483bcdd3f2a80cb28d6855e921e7973527a7a4ea` — absorbed first-use clarity, contextual actions, evidence depth, report/error/performance principles, and acceptance criteria.
4. `docs/ux-product-architecture-master.md` — source SHA `2c389df1aa6096a70b4ecf5be1a68911ff7fad2e` — absorbed coherent operating loop, page hierarchy, analytical tables, action hierarchy, governed AI, accessibility/mobile rules, and completion criteria.

Reference search returned no direct code references for these four exact source paths. No source is authorized for deletion in this wave.

Status: ABSORBED / SOURCE RETAINED.
