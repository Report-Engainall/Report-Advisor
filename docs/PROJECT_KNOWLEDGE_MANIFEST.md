# PROJECT KNOWLEDGE MANIFEST — الأغبري / Report-Advisor
Status: CANONICAL LINEAGE / CONSOLIDATION LEDGER
Authority: inventory and deletion gate only

## 1. Purpose
This manifest prevents information loss while the repository is consolidated. It never becomes a second source of product or engineering truth.

Deletion sequence:
INVENTORIED -> CLASSIFIED -> CONTENT ABSORBED -> REFERENCES CHECKED -> TESTS PASS -> MANIFEST RECORDED -> ARCHIVE/REMOVE

No source is marked REMOVE during an inventory-only pass.

## 4. Historical evidence is not duplicate product truth
Dated forensic evidence, exact-run artifacts, migration records, production snapshots and adversarial ledgers may remain historical because timestamp and immutable context are evidence. They are referenced from canonical masters, not used as product definitions.

## 5. Executable source is not copied into prose
Executable truth remains in:
src/, services/, api/, netlify/, supabase/, scripts/, .github/workflows/, tests/

The Manifest records what execution surfaces prove or protect; it does not duplicate their entire source.

## 6. Mandatory migration record
For every source selected for consolidation record:
- source path
- source SHA
- target owner
- unique rules extracted
- references/dependencies inspected
- tests/checks run
- unresolved conflicts
- final disposition
- absorption date/SHA

## 7. Deletion gate
A source may be physically deleted only when all are true:
- no unabsorbed unique content
- references/callers inspected
- no workflow/test dependency
- canonical owner contains the durable rule
- historical evidence retained when needed
- relevant checks pass
- deletion itself is a reviewed repository change

Otherwise status remains RETAIN.

## 8. First consolidation wave
1. PROGRAMMER_AUTONOMOUS_OPERATING_PROTOCOL -> SYSTEM_HEART
2. PROJECT_EXECUTION_INDEX -> MASTER_EXECUTION_INDEX pointer cleanup
3. REPORT_ADVISOR_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE -> MASTER_ENGINEERING_ARCHITECTURE
4. MASTER_PRODUCT_UI_ARCHITECTURE + UI/design-system specs -> MASTER_UI_UX_REFERENCE
5. runtime matrices/runbooks -> MASTER_RUNTIME_CERTIFICATION
6. tenant/security/data contracts -> MASTER_DATA_TRUTH_SECURITY
7. GTM/productization -> MASTER_COMMERCIAL_REFERENCE

Do not delete these sources in wave 1. Absorb, verify, then archive/remove in later gated waves.

## 9. Current consolidation status
CONTROL_PLANE_ESTABLISHED / CONTENT_MIGRATION_PENDING

The repository now has a canonical destination for each major knowledge class. The next work is content absorption and proof, not creation of additional competing master files.
