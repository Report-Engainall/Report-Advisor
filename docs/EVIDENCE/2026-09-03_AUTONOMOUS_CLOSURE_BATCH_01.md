# Autonomous Closure Batch 01 — 2026-09-03

## Exact execution boundary
- Previous deployed candidate: `0cd6f5a42392cb6cabfbdc473569f56b9a2ff6f1`
- Governance/test boundary: `b80e1299a626aa7eed08ac20ed48e5dff7b36dd7`
- No production alias mutation.
- No Auth mutation.
- No synthetic tenant data created.

## Completed work
1. Confirmed Vercel deployment `dpl_65UFrrkVWzprvKddupoHPbQBnp9b` is READY for `0cd6f5a...`.
2. Confirmed live HTTP response is 200 and Arabic RTL application shell loads.
3. Confirmed import progress monotonicity regression contract is represented in repository test coverage.
4. Confirmed terminal import lifecycle rejects terminal replay and remains tenant-bound.
5. Confirmed watched-file canonical boundary rejects traversal/absolute paths and binds folder to current tenant.
6. Added pure regression contract `scripts/import-progress-monotonic-contract.test.ts` to guard against future counter-regression changes.

## Certification rule
This document records autonomous closure work only. It does not promote any release gate to PASS without exact-SHA CI and live evidence.

## Remaining blockers
- Authenticated A/B browser adversarial evidence on current deployed candidate.
- Backup/restore/RPO/RTO live drill.
- Rollback/forward-recovery drill.
- Canonical approval authority/RBAC proof.
- OCR golden corpus runtime evidence.
