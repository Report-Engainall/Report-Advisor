# CURRENT CONTROL-PLANE BOUNDARY — 2026-09-25 / CURRENT EXACT CODE HEAD 1C48

- MAIN HEAD OBSERVED BEFORE THIS WRITE: `7159553fcfc9d21304ffff60e1086a34b714ac09`.
- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `1c48b7eb7c53bfbb8876ba4ec22556a549d5c002` on PR #628.
- GOVERNANCE STATE: canonical resilience/session-pooler, cart schema, profiles lineage, customer-context helper lineage, and 50/50 UI/core control are intact.
- EXACT GITHUB EVIDENCE ON THIS HEAD: Final Certification `36092154899` SUCCESS; Quality `36092155018` SUCCESS; Full Product Browser E2E `36092154845` SUCCESS; Execution Enforcement `36092154917` SUCCESS; production-chain-guard `36092154839` SUCCESS; certification-evidence-boundary `36092154960` SUCCESS.
- VERCEL EXACT DEPLOYMENT: `dpl_HyB7EdGkm4ZTzTvgwKbz4VKRk8tM` READY, source SHA `1c48b7eb...`, preview alias `report-advisor-git-fix-update-migration-contract-131e1d-injaz2.vercel.app`; production remains SHA `7be9f014...`.
- PHASE-F: run `36092155116` on `1c48b7eb...` was cancelled before a job started; connector retry is forbidden by GitHub API (403), and local gh CLI is unauthenticated. No Phase-F PASS is claimed.
- ROOT CAUSE CHAIN CLOSED IN CODE: countSql → carts/cart_items → customer-context helpers → profiles schema drift have each been repaired and locally contract-tested.
- VERIFIED LOCAL EXACT CANDIDATE: migration schema audit PASS (255 migrations / 114 tables / 127 indexes / 122 policies / 11 triggers / 0 findings); Phase-2 security-definer surface PASS; migration dependencies/tenant-security/global-RLS/import contracts PASS; Phase-F runtime closure PASS; operational resilience/evidence integrity PASS; knowledge architecture PASS; Product-WOW/UI route contracts PASS.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: trigger one fresh Phase-F on the exact current candidate after this governance write; consume only its result; if restore passes, repair/align only remaining production identity or rollback baseline; then measure RPO/RTO and close release.
- DO NOT REPEAT: countSql, carts/cart_items, helper search_path, profiles lineage, stale evidence transfer, production-SHA bypass, or speculative UI rewrites.
- UI LANE: 40 application routes / 38 canonical navigation links; Executive, Connections, Decision, Document, Inventory and Product-WOW contracts green.
- CORE LANE: fresh Phase-F → exact production identity → measured backup/restore/RPO/RTO/rollback → release closeout.
- CURRENT RESUME POINTER: `1c48b7eb... governance write → fresh Phase-F → first new live failure only → production alignment → measured recovery → release closeout`.



- MAIN HEAD OBSERVED BEFORE THIS WRITE: `7159553fcfc9d21304ffff60e1086a34b714ac09`.
- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `a851e3f1adc10d5e6234ad4e6d6f509f87e614cc` on PR #628.
- GOVERNANCE STATE: Decision Playbooks and resilience/session-pooler repairs remain intact; this candidate additionally restores missing commerce cart schema lineage required for logical backup restore.
- DONE — CORE: canonical migration `20260925033521_reconcile_live_cart_schema.sql` recreates/guards `public.carts` and `public.cart_items` with live constraints, indexes, RLS and authenticated self-select policies.
- LIVE DB RECONCILIATION: Supabase staging accepted migration `reconcile_live_cart_schema` as migration version `20260925033521`; live schema already matched these objects, so no business data was altered.
- VERIFIED LOCAL EXACT HEAD: migration schema audit PASS (255 migrations, 113 tables, 125 indexes, 121 policies, 11 triggers, 0 findings); Phase-F runtime closure PASS; operational resilience/evidence integrity PASS; Product-WOW UI PASS; git diff --check PASS.
- PREVIOUS EXACT PHASE-F RESULT: run `36090389863` on `2d9f46b...` failed 1/4. Tenant canary passed; production health was exact-SHA mismatch; backup/restore reached restore and failed on missing `public.carts`; rollback-forward drill was HTTP 503 because production forward baseline was unavailable.
- ROOT CAUSE CLOSED: `public.carts` and `public.cart_items` existed in Supabase but had no corresponding repository migration, causing fresh logical restore schema drift. The canonical migration now restores that lineage.
- VERCEL: branch deployment for the next exact candidate must be checked; do not transfer preview evidence from earlier SHAs.
- PHASE-F: fresh live proof is required on the new exact head after governance rebind. Current production alias remains on old SHA `7be9f014...`; RPO/RTO/rollback/production identity are still NOT PROVEN.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: commit governance rebind for `a851e3f...`, consume fresh exact-head quality/Browser/Enforcement/Final Certification, then consume fresh Phase-F; repair only the first newly reproduced live failure.
- DO NOT REPEAT: old `countSql` defect, stale cart schema state, unchanged Phase-F credentials, historical PASS transfer, production-SHA bypass, or speculative UI rewrites.
- UI LANE: 40 application routes / 38 canonical navigation links remain green; Decision Playbooks is closed and no new surface defect is evidenced.
- CORE LANE: exact-head certification → fresh Phase-F restore proof → exact production alignment → measured RPO/RTO/rollback → release closeout.
- CURRENT RESUME POINTER: `a851e3f... governance rebind → fresh exact-head gates → fresh Phase-F → exact production alignment → measured recovery → release closeout`.



- MAIN HEAD OBSERVED BEFORE THIS WRITE: `7159553fcfc9d21304ffff60e1086a34b714ac09`.
- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `2d9f46b9960ec5895c1e34e4c03ab6621f9ebb04` on PR #628.
- GOVERNANCE STATE: the resilience runtime/session-pooler repair remains intact; Phase-F logical-backup count generation was fixed on this exact candidate with a regression assertion.
- DONE — CORE: fixed the Phase-F logical backup table-count SQL so PostgreSQL `format()` receives all placeholders; added an exact source regression guard.
- VERIFIED LOCAL EXACT HEAD: resilience runtime/adversarial PASS; operational resilience + backup evidence integrity PASS; Phase-F runtime closure PASS; typecheck PASS; production build reached completion without source/build error.
- EXACT GITHUB RESULT BEFORE THIS REBIND: Phase-F run `36090073070` on `69bf751...` failed 1/4; first code failure was `too few arguments for format()`, plus production SHA mismatch and rollback baseline HTTP 503. That failure is now repaired in `2d9f46b...`.
- CURRENT GITHUB RESULT ON `2d9f46b...`: certification-boundary/enforcement initially failed only because this index still pointed at `80b7634...`; Browser E2E, production-chain-guard, and evidence-boundary passed. No new product/runtime defect was reproduced by the boundary failure.
- VERCEL: deployment `dpl_CqMY8jmLXoDeSFmoSoshyrJkyuBk` is READY and is built from exact SHA `2d9f46b...`; production alias is not yet proven to serve this SHA.
- PHASE-F: a fresh live run on `2d9f46b...` is still required after this exact governance rebind. Backup/restore, measured RPO/RTO, rollback, and production identity remain NOT PROVEN until that run succeeds.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: rebind this index to `2d9f46b...`, consume fresh exact-head Enforcement/Final Certification, then align the production alias to the READY exact deployment and run Phase-F once against the changed runtime boundary.
- DO NOT REPEAT: stale candidate binding, unchanged Phase-F reruns, historical PASS transfer, production-SHA bypass, unnecessary deployment churn, or reopening closed migration/runtime contracts without a new reproduced failure.
- UI LANE: Decision Playbooks closure remains complete; current route/surface contracts are green. Continue UI only on newly evidenced cross-surface defects.
- CORE LANE: exact-head governance → production exact deployment identity → live backup/restore → measured RPO/RTO/RTO/rollback → release closeout.
- CURRENT RESUME POINTER: `2d9f46b... index rebind → fresh exact-head certification → exact production alignment → fresh Phase-F → measured backup/restore/RPO/RTO/rollback → release closeout`.



- MAIN HEAD OBSERVED BEFORE THIS WRITE: `7159553fcfc9d21304ffff60e1086a34b714ac09`.
- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `80b7634f9bf309602914ddd383546cdb83aaf727` on the active PR #628 branch; this is newer than the prior governed UI candidate.
- GOVERNANCE STATE: the resilience code head contains the Decision Playbooks closure plus the live logical-source/session-pooler resilience repair; no historical evidence is transferred to this head.
- DONE: Decision Playbooks is a real canonical route backed by the existing recommendation ledger, with loading/error/empty/filter/status-action states and evidence/decision navigation.
- DONE: resilience runtime now derives a safe Supabase session-pooler fallback from the authorized direct source and guards outbound network targets.
- VERIFIED EXACT HEAD: GitHub Actions run `36086967892` certification-evidence-boundary SUCCESS; production-chain-guard SUCCESS; deployment statuses SUCCESS for Netlify preview and Vercel preview on `80b7634...`.
- CURRENT FAILURE: Final Certification run `36086965404` failed at certification-boundary-integrity because the index still referenced `8ceb5923...`; no product/runtime defect was reproduced by that failure.
- PHASE-F: live backup/restore, measured RPO/RTO, rollback and current production identity remain NOT PROVEN. Do not transfer older evidence.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: rebind the execution index to `80b7634...`, run local exact-head gates, push the corrected branch state, consume fresh Final Certification/Browser/Enforcement evidence, then rerun Phase-F only with the changed authorized resilience input.
- DO NOT REPEAT: stale candidate binding, unchanged Phase-F credentials, historical PASS transfer, production-SHA bypass, or unnecessary deployment churn.
- UI LANE: Decision Playbooks closure is complete; continue only on newly evidenced cross-surface gaps.
- CORE LANE: current priority is exact-head certification → live Phase-F recovery → production identity; independent security/contract/performance cleanup may proceed without waiting.
- CURRENT RESUME POINTER: `80b7634... exact-head rebind → fresh Final Certification/Browser/Enforcement → authorized live Phase-F → measured backup/restore/RPO/RTO/rollback → release closeout`.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-22 / WAVE 102 — UNIFIED IMPORT HISTORY CLOSURE

> Exact-head evidence only. The current code/test candidate is the exact SHA where the Import Center contract, bounded history focus, DataTable pagination, and Browser E2E were freshly proven.

- CURRENT MAIN HEAD OBSERVED: `28691df0781b101ddf053425d5d6eddee999438a`.
- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `28691df0781b101ddf053425d5d6eddee999438a`.
- DONE: fixed `scripts/check-import-center-product-contract.mjs` so `missingDataTable` is initialized before validation; the previously masked contract defect is now exposed rather than hidden.
- DONE: restored real bounded pagination controls in `src/components/ui/DataTable.tsx`; the component now provides previous/next navigation and explicit Arabic table-navigation semantics.
- DONE: preserved bounded import-history reads while adding an exact `focusJobId` readback path in canonical `fetchImportRecords`.
- DONE: `queries-compat.ts` now forwards `fetchImportRecords` to the canonical implementation instead of owning a duplicate implementation.
- DONE: Browser E2E trigger now explicitly covers `src/components/ui/DataTable.tsx`.
- EXACT-HEAD LOCAL PROOF: Import Center product contract PASS; TypeScript typecheck PASS; Execution Enforcement protocol PASS on `28691df...`.
- EXACT-HEAD QUALITY: GitHub Actions Quality run `35778954134` / job `106919207242` completed SUCCESS with all 63 release-readiness steps successful, including lint, build, performance budget, tenant RLS, import contracts, and intelligence/production contracts.
- EXACT-CODE BROWSER PROOF: Full Product Browser E2E run `35778953810` / job `106919205127` completed SUCCESS on exact `28691df...`; authenticated real-business persistence reached authoritative import completion and canonical persistence, and the prior history readback timeout did not recur.
- CURRENT GOVERNANCE REBIND REQUIRED: Execution Enforcement run `35778953651` and Final Certification run `35778953731` on `28691df...` failed only because the Master Index still pointed to `772afb548f6c381e2e3c6596a57d108ce6d2eebf`; no new product/runtime failure was reproduced there.
- PHASE-F BLOCKER: `RESILIENCE_LOGICAL_SOURCE_DB_URL` remains invalid/stale; live backup/restore, measured RPO/RTO, and rollback remain NOT PROVEN. Do not invent or guess the credential.
- HOSTING BLOCKER: connected Vercel production's newest observed production deployment is commit `84db430a0cde48963d7ff9045342bc31dc2d6063`; no current-candidate Production deployment exists for `28691df...`, so current-head production proof remains NOT PROVEN.
- OPEN OPERATIONAL DEBT: 151 `import_jobs` remain in `processing` at progress 0; no unsafe terminalization or deletion was performed.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: consume fresh Enforcement + Final Certification evidence after this index rebind, then continue Phase-F only after an authorized valid resilience source credential is available.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not weaken the certification boundary or browser assertions; do not transfer production evidence from `84db430...` to `28691df...`; do not rerun Phase-F with the unchanged invalid credential; do not mutate the 151 stale jobs without a governed recovery contract.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-22 / WAVE 91 — EXACT-HEAD CANDIDATE REBIND
- CURRENT_CODE_TEST_CANDIDATE: `fc0a84d85e56f43112df7e07886a9f6c04089998`.
- CURRENT GOVERNANCE HEAD: `f1c7685344da1cd202819b74e871c13e379170e7`.
- REASON: the current source candidate is the exact SHA where the unified document import regression was fixed and source/build contracts were freshly verified. Later commits are governance-only memory records.
- VERIFIED: Product WOW UI contract PASS; connections/language contract PASS; Vite production build PASS; unified decision/evidence/action/learning/runtime contracts PASS.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: consume fresh Phase-F and Final Certification evidence against the exact candidate lineage; repair only a reproduced current-SHA failure.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not weaken certification boundary; do not transfer historical certification; do not create parallel import/document paths.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 65 — EXACT-HEAD CERTIFICATION REBIND

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT_CODE_TEST_CANDIDATE: `30cf5d6ecf5a91e65642a38df31087498f4e356c`.
- CURRENT GOVERNANCE HEAD: `30cf5d6ecf5a91e65642a38df31087498f4e356c`.
- DONE: Work Center explicitly labels the 500-row read as a bounded display window and no longer presents `rows.length` as `إجمالي السجل`.
- DONE: UI contract guards the bounded semantics.
- VERIFIED: source re-read on exact SHA; Supabase history index remains present; staging currently has `import_jobs=4477`; `backup_verification_runs=0`.
- VERIFIED: fresh exact-head verification has been triggered for `30cf5d6...`; predecessor quality failure was the Dashboard hook-order defect, now repaired.
- ROOT CAUSE CLOSED: certification parsing selected historical `84a62...` because the current boundary used the non-canonical `CURRENT CODE/TEST HEAD` wording.
- NETLIFY: READY production deploy is on old commit `21f6562...`; not current-head evidence.
- PHASE-F: canonical workflow remains fail-closed until the required live resilience configuration is actually provisioned.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: consume fresh Final Certification Gate + Execution Enforcement Contract on `30cf5d6...`, then continue Phase-F backup/restore/RPO/RTO/rollback evidence.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not transfer historical PASS, do not mislabel bounded history, do not use old Netlify deploy as current, do not invent Phase-F configuration.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 63 — DASHBOARD UI + EXACT-HEAD PROOF OPEN

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST HEAD: `476c4bb827c3a2d485726af6b2e5d3e5391ff33a`.
- DONE: Dashboard next action is now derived from live truth/decision state and rendered in both the decision brief and NEXT ACTION surface.
- DONE: Product WOW UI contract guards the new derivation and canonical route/rationale binding.
- VERIFIED: Supabase staging still exposes `idx_import_jobs_company_created_id`; `backup_verification_runs=0`; `import_jobs=4477`.
- NOT VERIFIED: fresh CI/build/browser runtime for `476c4bb...`; no PASS transferred from `84a62...`.
- PHASE-F: canonical workflow remains fail-closed until live resilience configuration is actually provisioned; required configuration includes `RESILIENCE_MAX_RPO_SECONDS` and backup/restore runtime target/credentials. No values invented.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: consume or trigger the first fresh exact-head verification path for `476c4bb...`, while closing the external Phase-F configuration gate through the existing workflow.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not transfer historical browser/certification evidence; do not recreate import paths; do not weaken the Phase-F fail-closed guard.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 62 FINAL — RUNTIME PASS + PHASE-F EXTERNAL BLOCKER

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical production runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CERTIFIED MAIN BASELINE: `5367346e2837a06a4d1787bb016399245f213792`.
- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `84a62e169ce8db61d2dc6598e654127543ecdabb`.
- DATABASE FIX VERIFIED: migration `20260921194500_import_history_recent_window_index.sql` was committed and applied to Supabase staging; `idx_import_jobs_company_created_id` exists.
- EXACT-HEAD BROWSER RESULT: Full Product Browser E2E for `84a62...` completed **SUCCESS**. Build, exact checkout, app start, authenticated E2E contract, full product browser E2E, KPI evidence persistence, and real-business browser evidence completed without failure.
- ROOT CAUSE CLOSED: the real-business E2E timeout was an import-history scale/performance boundary on a tenant with 4,471 import jobs; the bounded query lacked its matching composite index.
- REPOSITORY CI ON MAIN BASELINE: quality, Final Certification Gate, Execution Enforcement Contract, Final Execution Batch, and Storage Tenant Isolation all PASS.
- PHASE-F RESULT: governed same-repo PR #611 executed the real Phase-F workflow. Checkout, local operational resilience, static resilience contracts, continuous trust, and authenticated canary session all PASS. Live resilience probes fail-closed with `PHASE_F_STATUS=BLOCKED EXTERNAL` because required live resilience configuration is not provisioned; at minimum `RESILIENCE_MAX_RPO_SECONDS` and backup/restore runtime credentials/config are absent.
- SUPABASE PROJECT STATE: `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`; database host is `db.fnqbvfuwbdpwvhcgzksl.supabase.co`. This does not substitute for restore/RPO/RTO evidence.
- VERCEL: current production build status remains blocked by `build-rate-limit`; no current-head Vercel production PASS is claimed.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: provision the missing Phase-F live resilience configuration in the GitHub execution environment, rerun Phase-F, and consume real backup/restore + RPO/RTO + rollback evidence. Then continue worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder runtime → final production certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not treat local/source resilience contracts as RPO/RTO proof; do not transfer browser PASS to old Vercel deployments; do not invent missing secret values; do not merge the closed probe branch.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 61 — IMPORT HISTORY DATABASE PERFORMANCE

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `84a62e169ce8db61d2dc6598e654127543ecdabb`.
- ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: `import_jobs` had no composite index for the exact bounded history order/filter `company_id, created_at DESC, id ASC`; the affected tenant had 4,471 import jobs.
- FIX APPLIED: migration `20260921194500_import_history_recent_window_index.sql` creates `idx_import_jobs_company_created_id`.
- DB PROOF: Supabase staging now exposes that index in `pg_indexes`.
- UI/query FIX from Wave 60 remains: bounded recent history read without global exact count.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: exact-head Browser E2E on `84a62...`, with emphasis on unified import history readback; then consume quality/certification and continue Phase-F/RPO-RTO.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not restore global count rejection; do not remove the composite history index; do not transfer f6d6 browser evidence to 84a62.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 60 — IMPORT HISTORY SCALE CLOSURE

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `f6d6e64b5da8411ec7bcc49fe912a0af04db86aa`.
- ROOT CAUSE CLOSED: `fetchImportRecords()` rejected any tenant with more than 500 import rows because it requested `count: 'exact'` and converted `count > 500` into `REPORT_QUERY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.
- LIVE E2E OBSERVATION: the affected tenant had 4,471 import jobs; the newly imported customer job itself completed successfully with one canonical row and provenance. The UI history failed only when rendering the bounded history because the read function rejected the large total count.
- FIX: canonical and compatibility import-history reads now use only the existing bounded latest-500 window; no global count query, no unbounded tenant read, no new RPC, and no new import route.
- UI: the import history header explicitly states that it shows the latest 500 while older records remain stored.
- NEXT: fresh exact-head quality, certification, final execution, storage, and browser E2E on `f6d6...`; then re-check real business persistence and continue Phase-F/RPO-RTO.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 58 FINAL — CERTIFIED UI CLOSURE, RUNTIME BLOCKER

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `cbfb7d0906e893ac32e274b571519d6f536ff8ad`.
- GOVERNED MAIN DESCENDANT CERTIFIED: `2b9d28c9a1a8fa12677c03f11b7ba94e2a3dbac7` (documentation/governance descendants only).
- CI PASS: quality, Execution Enforcement Contract, Final Execution Batch, Storage Tenant Isolation, Final Certification Gate.
- UI DONE: Connections source status and next action are state-derived and guarded.
- RUNTIME BOUNDARY: current main has Vercel `failure / build-rate-limit` and Vercel deployment `pending`; no live/browser PASS is claimed.
- BACKUP/RPO-RTO: source-level contracts are PASS, but staging still reports `backup_verification_runs=0`; restore/RPO/RTO runtime proof remains open.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: obtain a real exact-head deployment/browser runtime result for `2b9d28c9...`; then run/consume governed Phase-F backup/restore → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not transfer old Vercel READY deployments, do not call source contracts runtime evidence, do not fabricate E2E secrets or browser sessions, do not bypass Phase-F gates.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 58 — CONNECTIONS STATE-DRIVEN UI

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `cbfb7d0906e893ac32e274b571519d6f536ff8ad`.
- DONE: Connections summary is now state-derived: proven/bounded/adapter counts and next-source action come from the existing connector array.
- UI CONTRACT: current Product WOW contract guards the new state-derived summary.
- ARCHITECTURE: no new route/RPC/runner/importer/tenant/calculation path.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: consume fresh quality/enforcement/final-certification for `cbfb...`; then exact-head runtime/browser, backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not restore hard-coded connector counts or generic next-source text; do not transfer `9684...` certification evidence to this new SHA.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 57 — CURRENT-SHA UI CONTRACT REPAIR

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `c88abe725b066d8bbeb80de629be6198791d1523`.
- DONE: corrected the Work Center UI contract guard so it asserts the actual null-safe `expiredActive` expression used by the current implementation.
- ROOT CAUSE OF THE FRESH CERTIFICATION FAIL: source guard drift, not a product/runtime failure.
- NO ARCHITECTURE CHANGE: only `scripts/check-product-wow-ui-contract.mjs` changed in this correction.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: consume fresh quality/enforcement/final-certification runs for `c88abe...`; repair only a reproduced current-SHA failure, then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not restore the stale literal assertion; do not weaken the guard to accept both correct and incorrect optional-state implementations; do not transfer certification from `88323...`.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 56 — EXACT-HEAD CERTIFICATION REBIND

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `88323d3fd8d5cc6cb8acca8e53894a11d72cb83e`.
- EXACT-HEAD QUALITY: 20/20 release-readiness stages PASS on this SHA after closing three typecheck defects exposed by the runner.
- CURRENT CERTIFICATION DIAGNOSIS: certification/enforcement gates rejected the run because their index still pointed to `435534c9...` while current code/test was `88323d3f...`.
- CORRECTION IN THIS WAVE: certification index/reference is being rebound to the real current code/test SHA through the existing governance files; no boundary weakening or bypass.
- PASSING INDEPENDENT RUNS ON CURRENT SHA: UI route completeness, storage tenant isolation, and Final Execution Batch.
- CURRENT RUNTIME BOUNDARY: Vercel runtime evidence is still not current-head proof; older READY deployments are not transferred.
- PRECISE NEXT ACTION: consume fresh Execution Enforcement Contract + Final Certification Gate after this rebind; repair only a reproduced current-SHA failure, then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 55 — WORK CENTER OPERATIONAL ACTIONABILITY

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `435534c9652ce30df9e55dc744d469782279c4fd`.
- UI IMPLEMENTATION: `src/pages/WorkCenterPage.tsx` at the current main code head; the exact implementation is source-re-read and bound by the product UI contract.
- UI CONTRACT: `scripts/check-product-wow-ui-contract.mjs` now asserts the state-derived next-action branches, canonical import action, filter actions, `aria-pressed`, and `aria-live`.
- DONE: Work Center now turns the live operational state into a concrete next action without inventing runtime state or creating a second workflow.
- EXACT SOURCE VERIFICATION: compare from `b01ae295...` to this candidate contains only `WorkCenterPage.tsx` and `check-product-wow-ui-contract.mjs`.
- CURRENT BUILD/DEPLOY BOUNDARY: Vercel current-head `failure` / `build-rate-limit`; Vercel deployment context `pending`; GitHub Actions exposes no workflow run for the current SHA. No current-head build/browser/runtime PASS is claimed.
- PRECISE STOP POINT: UI/actionability/accessibility closure is implemented and source-guarded; external runtime certification remains the execution boundary.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: fresh exact-head CI/build/Phase-F/browser/certification for `435534c9...`; repair only a reproduced current-SHA failure, then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not transfer older READY deployments; do not treat source guards as runtime certification; do not add parallel import/decision paths; do not use fake sessions or weaken deployment identity checks.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 54 — EXACT-SHA PHASE-F + LIVE SECURITY/DB CLOSURE

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `2c9b4756b43e2415fda8b37ea367d02c8570c22f`.
- PHASE-F PROBE: `97a52c0772089609ee3a5a5fb346839a3f8c6601`.
- PHASE-F CONTRACT GUARD: `91536018fb02b8918874c28ecedfb8ef7d5e5df3`.
- IMPORT PERFORMANCE MIGRATION: GitHub file `supabase/migrations/20260921182858_20260921183000_import_fk_performance_indexes.sql`; live migration version `20260921182858` / name `20260921183000_import_fk_performance_indexes`.
- LIVE SECURITY MIGRATION: repo migration `20260830061000_close_public_rpc_advisor_gaps`; live version `20260921182639`.
- DONE: Phase-F runtime health is now bound to the exact deployment SHA; two live SECURITY DEFINER exposure gaps were closed using the repository's existing hardening migration; six import-lineage FK indexes were added and the corresponding unindexed-FK advisor finding disappeared.
- EXACT SOURCE/DB VERIFICATION: GitHub source re-read confirms the probe/guard and migration file; Supabase migration history confirms both migrations live; post-change SQL confirms watched-file browser execute is revoked; performance advisor no longer reports unindexed FKs for the lineage path.
- CURRENT BUILD/DEPLOY BOUNDARY: Vercel current-head status is `failure` / `build-rate-limit`; Deployments is `pending`. No current-head build/browser/runtime PASS is claimed.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: obtain a fresh exact-head Phase-F/CI/browser result for `2c9b4756...`. The first health probe will now fail closed if `report-advisor.vercel.app` does not serve this exact SHA; once exact runtime is available, close backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not bypass the deployment-SHA check; do not transfer older Vercel READY evidence; do not remove unused indexes without usage evidence; do not blanket-revoke authenticated SECURITY DEFINER functions.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 53 — DECISION TRUTH SEMANTICS

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `3ab9e99a41676b22a6b61fe35db7891c7f170eac`.
- DECISION EXPERIENCE: implementation `58f6dd971ce905a3ea5a1f8670101e92c75ddade`; zero expected impact remains semantically valid.
- COMMAND CENTER: implementation `274f813567d111112d850a696035bf4aba604c28`; Money Recovery now reports receivables availability rather than recoverable-money certainty.
- UI CONTRACT: `3ab9e99a41676b22a6b61fe35db7891c7f170eac`.
- EXACT SOURCE VERIFICATION: current DecisionExperience, ExecutiveCommandCenter and UI guard were re-read after write; code changes are limited to the two intended UI semantics plus synchronized governance.
- CURRENT BUILD/DEPLOY BOUNDARY: exact-head Vercel `failure` / `build-rate-limit`, with deployment context `pending`; no runtime/browser/build PASS claimed.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: fresh exact-head CI/build/Phase-F/browser/certification for `3ab9e99a...`; repair only a reproduced current-SHA failure, then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not treat zero expected impact as missing; do not label receivables availability as recoverable money; do not transfer older deployments.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 52 — IMPORT HISTORY FAIL-CLOSED + LIVE DB POSTURE

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `d6aec3aa6285f852043c4b3b7b1bbb364305141b`.
- UI IMPLEMENTATION: `25c681ad540bacab9b0567d78b74a331ea224849` with initial action commit `e0978b867fbcd4a9a9f70b8d8f3515948dfaa590`.
- UI CONTRACT: `d6aec3aa6285f852043c4b3b7b1bbb364305141b`.
- DONE: Canonical Import history is now fail-closed: backend fetch errors are not represented as empty history; actual empty history has a real source-selection action.
- EXACT SOURCE VERIFICATION: `CanonicalImportPage.tsx` contains `historyError`, retryable `ErrorState`, `onRetry`, and the existing `reset` action; compare from `db047cb4...` is limited to the import UI and its UI guard.
- LIVE DB POSTURE: staging reports 103/103 public tables with RLS enabled; security advisor reports 60 authenticated SECURITY DEFINER findings and one leaked-password-protection warning. Core import/runtime functions were checked for actual product use before any privilege change; no unsafe blanket revoke was applied.
- CURRENT BUILD/DEPLOY BOUNDARY: exact-head Vercel is `failure` / `build-rate-limit`; Vercel deployment context is `pending`. No current-head build/browser/runtime PASS is claimed.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: fresh exact-head CI/build/Phase-F/browser/certification for `d6aec3aa...`; repair only a failure reproduced on this SHA. Then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not map history fetch failures to empty state; do not revoke authenticated execute from core RPCs without usage/tenant-boundary proof; do not transfer older deployment evidence.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 51 — INVENTORY EMPTY-STATE GOVERNANCE

> Exact-head evidence only. No historical deployment/runtime result is transferred.

- CURRENT CODE/TEST CANDIDATE: `c90a97aad3c353f031c80cfd0788836b20add1e1`.
- UI IMPLEMENTATION: `3b7f6e35f69bb53fd56a1714922376d4322ccd1a` (with initial actionable-state commit `976adb2b54ba52af9cadae4b4deb0085bdc539e8`).
- UI CONTRACT: `c90a97aad3c353f031c80cfd0788836b20add1e1`.
- DONE: Inventory empty states are now source-aware and filter-aware, with real next actions and no reload.
- EXACT SOURCE VERIFICATION: current `EntityPages.tsx` confirms `totalRows === 0` for source-empty and explicit `filter` + `filteredRows === 0` for filtered-empty.
- CURRENT BUILD/DEPLOY BOUNDARY: Vercel exact-head status remains `failure` / `build-rate-limit`; no runtime PASS is claimed.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: fresh exact-head CI/build/Phase-F/browser/certification for `c90a97aa...`; repair only a failure reproduced on this SHA. Then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not classify unknown counts as empty; do not transfer older READY deployments; do not recreate import workflows.

## CURRENT EXECUTION BOUNDARY — 2026-09-21 / WAVE 50 — DASHBOARD ANALYTICAL EMPTY STATES

- UI CONTRACT: `6ae2c1c5e41c85598d2b7a160b7fe681aa7e7e33`.
- DONE: Dashboard analytical empty states for trend, categories, customers and products now contain context-aware next actions; no values are fabricated.
- EXACT SOURCE VERIFICATION: current DashboardPage.tsx and its UI guard were re-read after commit; compare from `9dd467e...` to this candidate is exactly the two intended files.
- CURRENT BUILD/DEPLOY BOUNDARY: exact-head status is Vercel `failure` / `build-rate-limit` plus Vercel Deployments `pending`.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: fresh exact-head CI/build/Phase-F/browser/certification for `6ae2c1c5...`; repair only a failure reproduced on this SHA. Then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not restore passive dashboard analytical empties; do not transfer older READY deployments; do not use source guards as runtime certification.

- UI CONTRACT: `7301ae56b7c01723ebdcc78756fc8a1ea5ffe399`.
- DONE: four report pages now retry in place through their existing loaders; full browser reload is removed from report error recovery.
- EXACT SOURCE VERIFICATION: current ReportsPage.tsx contains zero `window.location.reload()` calls; exact compare from previous `69e56486...` head is limited to ReportsPage.tsx and its UI contract guard.
- CURRENT BUILD/DEPLOY BOUNDARY: exact-head status is Vercel `failure` / `build-rate-limit` plus Vercel Deployments `pending`.
- NEXT EXECUTABLE ACTION: fresh exact-head CI/build/Phase-F/browser/certification for `7301ae56...`; repair only a failure reproduced on this SHA. Then backup/RPO-RTO → worker/server-boundary → tenant A/B → server OCR → watched-folder → final certification.
- DO NOT REPEAT: do not restore full-page report retries; do not transfer older READY deployment evidence; do not count source-level verification as runtime PASS.
