## Cross-cutting master requirements
- Automatic watched-folder synchronization and incremental processing.
- Canonical text first, safe deterministic fallback, no fabricated extraction.
- Source/version/row lineage and provenance.
- Offline-first/local processing preference for large/sensitive files.
- AI advisory and evidence-bound; deterministic engines authoritative for numeric truth.
- Arabic/English digits, headers, units, currencies, dates and whitespace normalize deterministically.
- Product families and pack/weight variants inferred from normalized business evidence.
- Demand horizon configurable; never hard-code illustrative horizons as business rules.
- Alternative-item groups weighted by substitution behavior, availability, price/margin and pack equivalence.
- Inventory decisions protect liquidity and service-level constraints.
- Tenant isolation, provenance, idempotency and approval-by-default remain mandatory.

## Release blockers
- Any cross-tenant read/write/search/export/retrieval.
- Client-side-only paid-feature enforcement.
- Unverified/non-idempotent billing webhooks.
- Worker without tenant context and lease.
- AI retrieval without tenant namespace.
- Trial expiry destroying customer data.
- Raw-file access from analytics/forecast/recommendation layers.
- Dropped/silently ignored source fields.
- Failed typecheck/lint/build or required contract gate.
- Critical field auto-approved without sufficient evidence.
- Reconciliation mismatch silently committed.

- Transaction commit without explicit approval and READY status.
- Automation executor bypassing the unified decision chain.
- Replenishment exceeding protected liquidity.

- Observed outcome accuracy below configured safety threshold when enough feedback exists.
- Production SaaS certification blocker.
- Artifact integrity/hash verification failure.
- Stale/failed backup verification.
- Unresolved critical security finding.
- Expired/blocked trust certificate.
- Migration drift or non-reproducible release manifest.
- Failed release preflight/canary/stabilization verification.
- Failed tenant-isolation, billing-liveness or artifact-verification canary.
- Exhausted/invalid business-risk budget.
- Missing decision lineage or insufficient evidence quality.
- Watched-folder source collision without explicit reconciliation.
- Canonical-text provenance missing for successful extraction.
- Extraction failure incorrectly suppressing all downstream analysis.
