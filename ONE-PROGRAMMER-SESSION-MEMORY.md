CURRENT RESUME POINTER: docs/execution/CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md — code checkpoint 6798db8af5653e7b91e786c38d50fae279fccfa0.

NEXT: Validate the structured-table text-signal enhancement on 6798db8af5653e7b91e786c38d50fae279fccfa0; inspect Full Product Browser E2E and route refresh-readback; restore Handoff by recording its exact current diff and then read every exact-head gate.

Product acceptance is any supported uploaded file analyzed by source-bound generic intelligence. None of the 48 specialist archetypes is a required match; specialty analysis enriches only when evidence fits. The 48-profile real-source matrix is a diagnostic and must never block generic file analysis.

Latest code change (38b157a3d0e2dbfae658082ea2ce45891cd4cdb8):
- Replaced shared global Playwright pending request tracking and request counts with per-page WeakMap telemetry.
- Clear the previously settled page-local background request set, take a fresh baseline, then reload the Smart Report to test only current refresh traffic.
- Added scripts/check-browser-e2e-page-telemetry-contract.mjs and wired it before route proof in full-product-browser-e2e.yml.
- Commit: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Report-Advisor/commit/38b157a3d0e2dbfae658082ea2ce45891cd4cdb8.

Evidence from predecessor browser run 38287728412, head a14e7f5ca0eb545234f4d0d79ac4b5f846383d17: authenticated auth+tenant PASS; 31/32 route checks passed with zero failing routes and zero route HTTP/network failures. First smart-report render showed required markers, all six decision cards and correct reportJobId/sourceHash. Refresh readback remained NOT_PROVEN with one pending business_intelligence_decisions request. Business journey and smart report proof passed; generic file test printed GENERIC FILE ANALYSIS PASS. Source matrix showed 18/48 NOT_PROVEN, correctly non-blocking for generic analysis. Artifact: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Report-Advisor/actions/runs/38287728412/artifacts/11764164698.

Root cause identified in the test harness: a single pending-request Set and request counter were shared across multiple pages; refresh reused the earlier set. Supabase edge logs showed successful 200 reads and no matching PostgreSQL timeout; the new run must prove whether the refresh issue is resolved or a separate slow request remains.

Exact-head runs at the last read:
- Build 38290775338: IN PROGRESS.
- Full Product Browser E2E 38290775363: PENDING.
- Storage tenant isolation 38290775383: PASS.
Previous PASS at 8d8f4eb… for quality, build, handoff, Phase-F and final certification is predecessor-only and must not be reused as current-head proof.

Production last known SHA 858ef8e3e5bc5bf74430555eadfb9e6767be348b. Live production parity remains NOT PROVEN. Resume with run 38290775363, inspect the telemetry-contract step and route refresh result, then repair any remaining exact evidenced failure. Do not merge or deploy until exact-head release gates and production readback pass.
