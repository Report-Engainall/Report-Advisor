PR #912 = CLOSED / MERGED — https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Report-Advisor/pull/912
MERGE_STATE = PR #914 OPEN / NOT MERGED
PRODUCT_COMPLETE = NO
ACTION_STATUS = Vercel deployment workflow fix committed on the PR branch; current-head CI has been launched; first Session Handoff Contract failed because the workflow change had not yet been reported in the current execution checkpoint. This checkpoint records the change and preserves the prior record below.

IMPLEMENTED = YES_IN_PR — .github/workflows/vercel-production-deploy.yml now synchronizes the existing GitHub Actions RESILIENCE_OPERATIONAL_TOKEN secret to the Vercel production environment before pulling/building. It uses a mode-600 temporary file with a cleanup trap, Vercel CLI --sensitive --yes, and does not echo the token. Runtime auth remains fail-closed.
INTEGRATED = NO — PR #914 remains open.
PERSISTED = NOT_APPLICABLE_TO_THIS_CHANGE — this is deployment-environment configuration, not a report data write.
UI-EXPOSED = EXISTING_MAIN_ONLY — product source at ec0547c… serves an Arabic RTL app; no UI code changed in this PR.
READBACK-PROVEN = YES — workflow read back from GitHub at 198777e8f138799f7326a131c0c56ec8cb8e6cc7's branch commit; file blob before state update c9890fa2968b5ca0751532e5f44abe1ca7674c82.
BROWSER-PROVEN = PRIOR CODE SHA ONLY — authenticated Full Product Browser E2E passed on merge SHA 6dbc16ea1f762cb78b398c741d925c52275017fe; no new authenticated browser run has been claimed for this workflow-only change.
PRODUCTION_PROVEN = PARTIAL — versioned Vercel deployment dpl_2LmWMxKU5q3wCSt99iFkd5wK52Nw is READY at ec0547c7cc26a828c0e4bf8ba0279664461a7269; public homepage HTTP 200 reports Arabic RTL and the same source SHA. However /api/health and /api/tenant-canary currently return HTTP 503 operational_token_not_configured.
NETLIFY_PRODUCTION = BLOCKED — publish run 38294294516 failed with NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN missing and NETLIFY_SITE_ID blank. Latest Netlify production is still on SHA 858ef8e3e5bc5bf74430555eadfb9e6767be348b.
PHASE_F_LIVE_RESILIENCE = NOT_READY — run 38294294464: health HTTP 404 / DEPLOYMENT_SHA_MISSING; tenant-canary fetch failed; logical backup/restore PASS (RPO 62.72s, RTO 11.27s); rollback probe received the SPA HTML rather than function JSON/deployment identity. Overall 1/4 pass.
FIRST_ACTIVE_FAILURE = Session Handoff Contract run 38310330833 on code head 198777e8f138799f7326a131c0c56ec8cb8e6cc7 failed with "stale report; unreported files: .github/workflows/vercel-production-deploy.yml". This is a checkpoint/report coverage failure caused by the new workflow edit not being documented; this update is intended to repair that contract without relaxing it.
ROOT_CAUSE = Existing Vercel deployment workflow passed the Actions token only to the final health verifier but did not synchronize the same secret into Vercel production before `vercel pull` and `vercel build`. The live runtime therefore rejected requests with operational_token_not_configured. Netlify is independently blocked by missing repository deployment credentials; Phase-F runtime targets remain misconfigured.
WHAT_IS_PROVEN = Live GitHub main SHA ec0547c7cc26a828c0e4bf8ba0279664461a7269; PR #914 code head 198777e8f138799f7326a131c0c56ec8cb8e6cc7; workflow change was read back from GitHub and is ordered before production env pull. Main merge SHA 6dbc16ea1f762cb78b398c741d925c52275017fe passed Product Build Gate (38294294535), Quality (38294294479), Final Certification (38294294431), Session Handoff (38294294421), and Full Product Browser E2E (38294294413). These are predecessor/main code proof, not PASS claims for the open PR head.
WHAT_IS_NOT_PROVEN = PR #914 exact-head build/quality/certification after the latest checkpoint update; the manual Vercel deployment workflow has not yet been dispatched; fixed production health identity; Netlify deployment at current source SHA; Phase-F 4/4.
NEXT_EXACT_ACTION = Read the new branch head and its exact SHA-bound CI results after this state update; repair only any newly observed contract/test failure. Do not label production fixed until the Vercel manual deploy is run and the live health response proves the deployment SHA and ID. Netlify requires authorized NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and NETLIFY_SITE_ID Actions secrets.

ACTION_STATUS = core code merged; exact-head build/quality/certification/browser E2E pass; Vercel production is READY at 6dbc16ea1f762cb78b398c741d925c52275017fe; Netlify publish blocked by missing GitHub Actions secrets; Phase-F live resilience NOT READY.

CURRENT RESUME POINTER: docs/execution/CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md — current code checkpoint 6dbc16ea1f762cb78b398c741d925c52275017fe.

PROVEN ON EXACT MAIN SHA:
- Product Build Gate run 38294294535: PASS.
- Quality run 38294294479: PASS.
- Final Certification Gate run 38294294431: PASS.
- Session Handoff Contract run 38294294421: PASS.
- Full Product Browser E2E run 38294294413: PASS.
- Authenticated browser test proves tenant/session survives full page refresh; generic and XLSX uploads have durable canonical persistence/history and source-bound generic intelligence readback after refresh. The log explicitly records genericReadbackMode=RECOMPUTED_FROM_DURABLE_CANONICAL_ROWS and genericSourceBoundAfterRefresh=true.
- Browser artifact: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Report-Advisor/actions/runs/38294294413/artifacts/11768252264
- Vercel production deploy dpl_3MHFGEZgSs3CVVmH7kscLuXaoJuD is READY and points at 6dbc16ea1f762cb78b398c741d925c52275017fe.

ACTIVE BLOCKERS:
- Netlify production deploy run 38294294516: build passed, publish step failed because NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN is missing; NETLIFY_SITE_ID is also blank. The Netlify production deploy still serves SHA 858ef8e3e5bc5bf74430555eadfb9e6767be348b.
- Phase-F run 38294294464: NOT READY, 1/4 probes passed. Operational health returned HTTP 404 with missing deployment SHA; tenant-canary returned fetch failed; logical backup/restore passed with RPO 62.72s and RTO 11.27s; rollback probe received HTTP 200 but SPA HTML instead of function JSON/deployment identity.
- GitHub Pages deploy run 38294294425: build passed; deployment failed HTTP 404 because GitHub Pages is not enabled. Treat as optional static-only fallback, not as the product deployment.

NEXT: Add the authorized Netlify token and site ID as GitHub Actions repository secrets (never commit secret values), redeploy the exact current main SHA, check every live API route/identity, and rerun Phase-F until 4/4 probes pass. Do not relax fail-closed gates. Do not claim PRODUCT_COMPLETE while Netlify parity / Phase-F remain unresolved.

# LIVE RESUME — 2026-10-12 / BROWSER PAGE-TELEMETRY REPAIR

Repository: Report-Engainall/Report-Advisor
Branch: fix/source-bound-generic-intelligence-20261009
PR #912: OPEN / NOT MERGED.
Code checkpoint: 6798db8af5653e7b91e786c38d50fae279fccfa0
PRODUCT_COMPLETE = NO.
DO_NOT_MERGE = true.

CURRENT RESUME POINTER: docs/execution/CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md — code checkpoint 6798db8af5653e7b91e786c38d50fae279fccfa0.

NEXT: Validate the structured-table text-signal enhancement on 6798db8af5653e7b91e786c38d50fae279fccfa0; inspect Full Product Browser E2E and route refresh-readback; restore Handoff by recording its exact current diff and then read every exact-head gate.

Product acceptance is any supported uploaded file analyzed by source-bound generic intelligence. None of the 48 specialist archetypes is a required match; specialty analysis enriches only when evidence fits. The 48-profile real-source matrix is a diagnostic and must never block generic file analysis.

Latest code change (38b157a3d0e2dbfae658082ea2ce45891cd4cdb8):
- Replaced shared global Playwright pending request tracking and request counts with per-page WeakMap telemetry.
- Clear the previously settled page-local background request set, take a fresh baseline, then reload the Smart Report to test only current refresh traffic.
- Added scripts/check-browser-e2e-page-telemetry-contract.mjs and wired it before route proof in full-product-browser-e2e.yml.
- Commit: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Report-Advisor/commit/38b157a3d0e2dbfae658082ea2ce45891cd4cdb8.

Evidence from predecessor browser run 38287728412, head a14e7f5ca0eb545234f4d0d79ac4b5f846383d17: authenticated auth+tenant PASS; 31/32 route checks passed with zero failing routes and zero route HTTP/network failures. First smart-report render showed required markers, all six decision cards and correct reportJobId/sourceHash. Refresh readback remained NOT_PROVEN with one pending business_intelligence_decisions request. Business journey and smart report proof passed; generic file test printed GENERIC FILE ANALYSIS PASS. Source matrix showed 18/48 NOT_PROVEN, correctly non-blocking for generic analysis. Artifact: https://github.com/Report-Engainall/Report-Advisor/actions/runs/38287728412/artifacts/11764164698.

Root cause identified in the test harness: a single pending-request Set and request counter were shared across multiple pages; refresh reused the earlier set. Supabase edge logs showed successful 200 reads and no matching PostgreSQL timeout; the new run must prove whether the refresh issue is resolved or a separate slow request remains.

Exact-head runs at the last read:
- Build 38290775338: IN PROGRESS.
- Full Product Browser E2E 38290775363: PENDING.
- Storage tenant isolation 38290775383: PASS.
Previous PASS at 8d8f4eb… for quality, build, handoff, Phase-F and final certification is predecessor-only and must not be reused as current-head proof.

Production last known SHA 858ef8e3e5bc5bf74430555eadfb9e6767be348b. Live production parity remains NOT PROVEN. Resume with run 38290775363, inspect the telemetry-contract step and route refresh result, then repair any remaining exact evidenced failure. Do not merge or deploy until exact-head release gates and production readback pass.
